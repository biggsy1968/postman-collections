# What Are Postman Collections
This Repository contains postman collections. Postman Collections are a group of saved requests you can organize into folders.

These are known as Conditional workflows.
Each workflow is named and uses scripts to pass data between API requests and build workflows that mirror your actual API use case
This can help you understand the 'Happy Path' of our APIs and this can assist you in getting a handle on how the APIs work and be an invaluable tool in architecting your integration with Nuapay.
